# Shopify MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects Claude directly to your Shopify store. Manage products, orders, customers, collections, inventory, and fulfillments — all through natural language.

---

## What you can do with this

Once connected, you can talk to your Shopify store like this:

- *"Show me all unfulfilled orders from today"*
- *"Create a new product called Summer T-Shirt, price €29.99, set it to draft"*
- *"How many active products do we have?"*
- *"Search for customers with the email john@example.com"*
- *"Update inventory for product 123 to 50 units"*

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A Shopify store (any plan)
- A Claude.ai Pro, Team, or Enterprise account (for remote MCP connections)

---

## Step 1 — Get your Shopify credentials

You need two things: your **store name** and an **Admin API access token**.

### Find your store name

Your store name is the part before `.myshopify.com`.
Example: if your admin URL is `https://acme-store.myshopify.com/admin`, your store name is `acme-store`.

### Create a Custom App and get your access token

> ⚠️ **Important:** A regular Shopify API key will NOT work. You need an **Admin API access token** from a Custom App. Follow these steps exactly.

1. Go to **Shopify Admin** → **Settings** → **Apps and sales channels**
2. Click **Develop apps** in the top right corner
3. If prompted, click **Allow custom app development**
4. Click **Create an app**, give it a name (e.g. `MCP Server`), click **Create app**
5. Go to the **Configuration** tab → click **Configure Admin API scopes**
6. Enable the scopes you need. For full access, select:
   - `read_products`, `write_products`
   - `read_orders`, `write_orders`
   - `read_customers`, `write_customers`
   - `read_inventory`, `write_inventory`
   - `read_fulfillments`, `write_fulfillments`
   - `read_webhooks`, `write_webhooks`
7. Click **Save**
8. Go to the **API credentials** tab → click **Install app** → confirm
9. Click **Reveal token once** and copy the token immediately — it starts with `shpat_`

> 💡 Shopify only shows this token once. If you lose it, go back to API credentials, uninstall the app, then reinstall to generate a new one.

---

## Step 2 — Set up the server locally

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daanjonk/shopify-mcp.git
cd shopify-mcp
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure your environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
SHOPIFY_STORE=your-store-name
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> Only these two are required. Leave everything else as-is.

### Run the server

```bash
python server.py
```

You should see output like:

```
INFO  Token mode: static SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN (no auto-refresh)
INFO  Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

Your MCP server is running at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

## Step 3 — Deploy to the cloud

To use this server with Claude.ai, it needs a public URL. The easiest option is **Railway** — the free tier is enough to get started.

### Deploy on Railway

1. Fork this GitHub repo to your own account
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. Select your forked `shopify-mcp` repo
5. Railway detects the `Dockerfile` and starts building automatically
6. Once the build completes, go to your service → **Settings** → **Networking** → **Generate Domain**
7. Copy your public URL — it looks like `https://shopify-mcp-production.up.railway.app`

### Add your environment variables on Railway

In your Railway project, go to **Variables** and add the following:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SHOPIFY_STORE` | `your-store-name` |
| `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `PORT` | `8000` |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `streamable-http` |

Railway restarts your server automatically after saving.

---

## Step 4 — Connect to Claude

### Your MCP endpoint URL

Combine your Railway URL with `/mcp`:

```
https://your-app.up.railway.app/mcp
```

### Add the server in Claude.ai

> ⚠️ **Authentication token:** When adding a remote MCP server in Claude.ai, it will ask for an authentication token. This is a security token that protects your server endpoint — it is **separate** from your Shopify access token.

**To connect:**

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → click your profile icon (bottom left) → **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Integrations**
3. Click **Add integration**
4. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `Shopify`
   - **URL:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app/mcp`
5. For the **authentication token** field: leave it blank for now (your server does not require auth by default)

> If you want to secure your server with an authentication token (recommended for production), see the section below.

### Securing your server with a bearer token (recommended)

By default, anyone who knows your Railway URL can access your MCP server. To protect it, add a bearer token.

**Step 1 — Add a `BEARER_TOKEN` variable in Railway:**

Go to Variables in Railway and add:

```
BEARER_TOKEN=pick-a-long-random-string-here
```

**Step 2 — Add auth middleware to `server.py`:**

Add this block right after the line `mcp = FastMCP(...)`:

```python
import secrets
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from starlette.responses import Response

BEARER_TOKEN = os.environ.get("BEARER_TOKEN", "")

class BearerAuthMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        if BEARER_TOKEN:
            auth = request.headers.get("Authorization", "")
            if auth != f"Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}":
                return Response("Unauthorized", status_code=401)
        return await call_next(request)

mcp.app.add_middleware(BearerAuthMiddleware)
```

**Step 3 — Enter the token in Claude:**

When adding the integration in Claude.ai, paste your `BEARER_TOKEN` value into the **authentication token** field.

## Environment variables reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SHOPIFY_STORE` | ✅ | — | Store name, e.g. `my-store` (not the full URL) |
| `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | ✅* | — | Admin API token from Custom App (`shpat_...`) |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` | No | — | OAuth client ID (advanced, replaces static token) |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | — | OAuth client secret (advanced) |
| `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` | No | `2024-10` | Shopify Admin API version |
| `PORT` | No | `8000` | Port the server listens on |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | `streamable-http` | Transport protocol |
| `BEARER_TOKEN` | No | — | Protects your MCP endpoint (set in both Railway and Claude) |

*Either `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` **or** `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` + `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` is required.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed" (401)**
Your `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` is wrong or expired. Make sure it starts with `shpat_` and that the Custom App is installed on your store.

**"Permission denied" (403)**
Your token is missing required API scopes. Go back to your Custom App → Configuration → add the missing scopes → Save → reinstall the app (this generates a new token).

**"Missing SHOPIFY_STORE environment variable"**
Check that `SHOPIFY_STORE` is set to just the store name — not the full URL.
✅ `my-store` &nbsp; ❌ `my-store.myshopify.com` &nbsp; ❌ `https://my-store.myshopify.com`

**Claude can't connect to the server**
Make sure your Railway deployment is active and a domain is generated. Test by opening `https://your-app.up.railway.app/mcp` in a browser — you should get a response, not a 404.

**I lost my Shopify access token**
Shopify only shows it once. Go to Shopify Admin → Settings → Apps → your app → API credentials → Uninstall app → Install app again → Reveal token once.
